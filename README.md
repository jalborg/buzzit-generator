# buzzit-generator

I built a Buzzit title generator, and you won't believe what happened next!

Buzzit is the Norwegian version of Buzzfeed, the news site known for producing articles that blow your mind, melt your heart, and make you cry. At least thatâ€™s what their titles promise.
Making this I was inspired by the D2 generator, that creates fictitious, funny titles for the Norwegian magazine D2.

The concept of my website is simple: Click the button, and a new Buzzit title shows up.
